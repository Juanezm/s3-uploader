# S3 Uploader

## Requirements

A program that uploads files from a local directory to an AWS S3 bucket, following these requirements:

- The program should run on Linux
- The program will be given a base directory path and target s3 bucket name as configuration.
- The environment will provide the AWS credentials and region.
- The program will be executed on a timer (e.g systemd or cron)
- The base directory given in the configuration follows this structure: base-dir/location/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/mm-topic.dat
- The dat files are generated by another service, and files will usually be finished writing within a few seconds of the timestamp of the data.
- The uploaded objects must be in the same directory structure as the base directory.
- dat files that have been successfully uploaded should be deleted from the base directory.
